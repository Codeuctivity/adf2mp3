# ADF2MP3 - A command line tool for converting GTA Vice City ADF audio files to MP3

----

## About:

[*Grand Theft Auto - Vice City*][1] radio stations and soundtracks are stored in a proprietary file format,
with the `.adf` extension. This file format is a MP3 that had each byte *XORed* with
the decimal constant `34`. The `adf2mp3` command line tool allows the decoding of Vice City
ADF files to MP3 files that can be played outside the game.

## Usage:

This tool can be used from the command prompt as such:

    $ ./adf2mp3 flash.adf

Looks for the file "flash.adf" in the current directory and writes a
file named "flash.mp3" to the current directory as its output. You can
also provide an explicit output filename as the third parameter:

    $ ./adf2mp3 flash.adf flash_fm_radio.mp3

To print basic help and tool info, run:

    $ ./adf2mp3 --help

     |
     +-ports/                    => Ported versions of the original C++ code. Currently, I've written a Rust version of the tool that works just as well.
